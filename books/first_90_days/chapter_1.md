# Chapter 1

> This does not contain the notes for promotiosn just yet. 


This chapter is all about **preparation**. Going back to [[Introduction]]  you can see that those traps are what can hold you back in the two types of transitions that is being a leader in a new job or a promotion. Leadership in a new company is by far the more difficult task. 

## New company onboarding

1. You need to do **business orientation**. This means getting a better understanding of the company that you have joined, how the team you joined is placed in the broader organizatino. What are the organization's objectives, how do you and your team fit in the big picture. 
2. **Connect with the right stakeholders**.It's important to build the right relationships as soon as possible. This is especially important for peers that can become your advocates and help you accomplish your goals. *It's important to not just focus on building relationships with leadership and your reports. The peers are key!*
3. **Align expectations early and frequently**. Right away, negotiate with your boss about what the short term expectations are from you. 
4. **Understanding and adapting to the new culture**:
	1. Identifify how the culture of the new place differs from what you know and did before. For example, some places can be process focused and authority driven. Other places could be consensus driven. In each situation, effective action could look different. 
	2. There are the visible indicators like symbols/language etc. that you see in the public writing in the company. But there are norms and patterns of behaviour that you need to be pay attention to. These behaviours and norms usually shed light on a set of fundamental assumptions and values that the company and more importantly the sub-culture of your team could hold. An example could come to light during meetings. Are these meetings a place where a decision is ratified based on discussions that happened in the background privately, or is the meeting a place to discuss and come up with a decision. The nuanced differences in the culture should help you adapt and take action effectively. 
	3. A framework to use for cutlural norms can be found broken down to: 
		1. Influence: How do people get the support that they need for an important initiative. Do you need someone from the senior team or peers. 
		2. Meetings: Do disagreements happen in public or private. 
		3. Execution: When it comes to executing on a project, do you need a significant amount of deep technical knowledge or primarily knowing the right people. 
		4. Conflict: Can people talk about issues openly or are they avoiding conflict because they are worried about a backlash. 
		5. Recognition: Do the most vocal and visible individuals get rewarded or the quiet leaders that build collaboratively. 
		6. Ends vs. means: Are there a set of rules associated with how results are achieved? What are these processes. \

## Strengths and Weaknesses
After doing the excercise on page 26, identify your preferences for problems and functions. The functions are catagorized as HR, finance, marketing, operations, R&D and the functions are technical, political and cultural. After doing the excercise, identify which categories scored lower. In my case, that would be the political category. This means that this could be a potential blindspot. 

Then ask, what implications could the blindspot have in your current role. 

When it comes to **strength**, it's important to keep in mind that your strengths could be a blindspot where you will try to solve all problems with the toolkit that comes from your strengths. Even if that's not the right approach. 

TLDR; 

1. If joining a new organization, you need to reorient yourself and connect with key individuals and identify/adapt to the new culture. 
2. Reflect on whether you can succeed in the new role with your previous strengths. If not, what do you need to develop. 
3. Be honest about whether there are aspects of the new job that are necessary for success but you don't focus on it because it's not your preference. 
4. Who can you ask for advice/counsel when you are in this transition.
